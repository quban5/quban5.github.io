                                    Project Ideogram (working title) is a 2D logic adventure game with hand-drawn animations. The core of the gameplay is the <span class="bold-text">translation of words, concepts, and sentences from natural language into a fictional ideogram script that I created</span>. The player also needs to combine existing ideograms to form new ones and progress to subsequent levels.

                                <p class="project-content-text">
                                    Puzzle solving will be enriched with a <span class="bold-text">narrative</span> about the complex life of an ancient human, depicted in a style reminiscent of cave paintings. Animations will be hand-drawn frame by frame, giving a distinctive artistic style. The storyline is intended to assist the player in puzzles and sometimes guide them to solutions, as well as generally enrich the overall experience.

                                    The player has access to a set of ideograms, initially small but expanding over time. For example, on the first level, the prompt reads: "Beginning." The player’s palette contains three ideograms meaning: "sun", "beginning", and "end". To advance to the next level, the player must drag the "beginning" ideogram from their palette onto the designated area on the screen. In the next level, the concept "sunrise" appears. The player does not yet have that ideogram and must create it. A special area or tab on the screen will serve as a workspace for combining ideograms (the UX/UI details are subject to iteration and testing). The player combines the two available ideograms: "sun" and "beginning". This yields a new ideogram: "sunrise", which is added to their palette of usable ideograms. The player then drags the new ideogram to the target area to proceed.

                                    The storyline follows an ancient human experiencing various life events and challenges. The player’s progress through puzzles and levels parallels the main character’s life journey. Starting with simple observations of nature and phenomena, the character will later cultivate fields and eventually build a family and undertake other (often more dangerous) tasks. This is meant to be an engaging adventure and narrative that motivates the player to continue solving puzzles to discover the next part of the story. A detailed narrative outline does not yet exist at this stage, as the story is designed to complement and integrate with the puzzles. My plan is to first design a solid pool of well-crafted levels and then write the story to tie everything together.

                                    Due to the demanding technique, the game will not be long—around one hour of gameplay.

                                    The idea for the game came to me while reading Adrian Frutiger’s book <span class="italic-text">Signs and Symbols: Their Design and Meaning</span>. The author described an interesting example from Chinese script: there is a character meaning "door" and a character meaning "ear". The character for "to eavesdrop" or "to spy" is simply a combination of these two characters.
                                </p>
                                <p class="project-content-text">
                                    I took inspiration for creating my own ideograms from Chinese script, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Sumerian writing. My initial script designs were very pictorial and over time felt inconsistent. I decided to redraw them and adopt the principle of using only shapes based on arcs, semicircles, circles, and straight lines. I strive to avoid creating many right angles so that the script feels "fluid and rounded" and gives an impression of coherence.
