                                    <span class="italic-text">Gobstones is an ancient wizarding game that resembles marbles, the principal difference being that every time a point is conceded, the winning stone squirts a foul-smelling liquid into the loser's face.</span> - <span class="italic-text">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span> (J.K. Rowling, 1999).
                                </p>
                                <p class="project-content-text">
                                    While the game of gobstones itself wouldn't be difficult to transfer to a video game (gobstones have already appeared in several games), spraying the player with a foul-smelling liquid can be done in different ways. In my idea, I mainly wanted to <span class="bold-text">convey the whole unpleasant situation and the general inconvenience of being sprayed with something smelly</span>.
                                </p>
                                <p class="project-content-text">
                                    My idea would apply to open-world games such as <span class="italic-text">Hogwart's Legacy</span>.
                                    <br />
                                    <br>
                                </p>

                                </p>

                                    The most obvious solution is to act on the virtual camera. During the loss of points, the gargoyles spit on the character controlled by the player, which will manifest itself in the effect of a dirty (green-yellow ooze) and smudged virtual camera lens. The player character can also make a sound of disgust or comment somehow: “Yuck!”, ‘Gross!’, ‘Ow!’, ‘Uhh...’. The opponent could also react to it somehow, laughing or mocking the player character.
                                </p>

                                        <li class="unordered-list-item-generic">
                                            How long would the screen be smudged and dirty?<br />The effect could just gradually disappear completely after a few or more seconds.
                                        </li>
                                        <li class="unordered-list-item-generic">
                                            Will the effect leave its mark on the camera for the rest of the game of gobstones?<br />
                                            In the book gobstones punish the loser in a way that cannot be easily transferred to the game. The player could also be punished by reducing visibility. A slightly blurry and dirty camera could make it difficult to continue playing. The question remains whether this is overkill. Losing points is a handicap in itself and affects the player because he lost the round. Limiting visibility may already be a step too far.
                                        </li>
                                        <li class="unordered-list-item-generic">
                                            How would it affect the player? Would it motivate him, amuse him, or the opposite?<br />
                                            Everyone may react differently. Different solutions would have to be tested.

                                    In <span class="italic-text">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span>, each of the NPCs in the game world can have a different initial dialogue greeting when the player wants to talk to them. Some NPCs can tell the main character directly that he is dirty and to wash up or they will be cold towards him.
                                </p>
                                <p class="project-content-text">
                                    All of this directly affects the player's experience and shows him what attitude the NPCs have toward the character he is leading. This treatment can deepen the sense of immersion and presence in the world and enhances the sense of agency.
                                </p>

                                    <span class="bold-text">Implementation</span><br />
                                    NPCs may comment on the appearance and smell of the main character when the player walks past them: “What smells so bad here?” “Someone must have farted...” (the infantile nature of the statement is worth taking into account - after all, Hogwarts students are children). When a player passes by a teacher, the teacher can scold him, deduct 5 points from the house he belongs to, or take mercy and cast a cleaning spell on the hero. Starting dialogues with NPCs can also begin with a comment on appearance and smell.
                                </p>
                                <p class="project-content-text">
                                    To get rid of dirt and odor, the player could simply enter the school's restroom and simply wash and clean his robe. The player could also learn a quick cleaning spell for the main character at some point in the game. "<span class="italic-text">Sanitarum!</span>"
