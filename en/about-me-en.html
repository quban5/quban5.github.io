                            I want to create games and experiences that will be as important to others as the video games were to me

                            <span class="bold-text">Video games hold a special place in my heart</span>. When I got <span class="italic-text">Asterix & Obelix XXL</span> and <span class="italic-text">Tigger's Honey Hunt</span> into my six-year-old hands, it became clear to me that I couldn't imagine my life without games.

                            Ever since I can remember, I have enjoyed creating and building something - from houses made of bricks to roads, tracks and entire stylized settlements in Minecraft. I also happened to write some stories and poems. <span class="bold-text">That's why working in game development is a dream of mine, because it combines my two greatest passions: creating, designing and writing with video games</span>.

                            Learning new things gives me great satisfaction. One of my side projects is a website for the PTTK “Szaniec” Skierniewice, for which (and this portoflio) I learned HTML and CSS. Wanting to create my own modded Minecraft server for friends, I mastered the basics of Linux and putting a server on Oracle Cloud and operating it via SSH and FTP. <span class="bold-text">So it doesn't matter to me if I don't know or can't do something - if I'm very interested in something, I'll master it quickly with full commitment</span>.

                            I am currently studying Audiovisual media and digital culture (MA) at the University of Lodz. I have gained theoretical knowledge in the fields of <span class="bold-text">media studies, game studies and culture studies</span>. I took classes in history and types of video games, analysis, critique and poetics of games, rule design, gamification, interactive narrative, as well as UI and UX. I also have basic knowledge of graphic design, new media art, databases, information visualization, generative art, art history and in the theory of culture.

                            The topic of my thesis is the problem of the availability of older games in digital distribution. Among other things, I intend to present this phenomenon and its complexities, and, with the help of Python scripts, collect and analyze data from Metacritic and investigate what percentage of PC games released by 2015 are not legally available for purchase in digital stores (not second-hand).

                            In my free time, I love to play all sorts of games. Recently I've been playing with friends on a modded <span class="italic-text">Minecraft</span> server, but also <span class="italic-text">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span> and <span class="italic-text">Dark Souls III</span>.<br /><span class="bold-text">In addition to the above, my most important and favorite games are: <span class="italic-text">Red Dead Redemption</span> 1 and 2, <span class="italic-text">The Witcher series</span>, <span class="italic-text">Pentiment</span>, <span class="italic-text">Journey</span>, <span class="italic-text">What Remains of Edith Finch</span>>, the <span class="italic-text">Half-Life</span> series, the <span class="italic-text">Portal</span> series and <span class="italic-text">Hollow Knight</span>.</span>.

                            I am also interested in new technology, computer science, pop culture, history and politics. In the summer, on the other hand, I'm into winemaking, and with bonsai trees - I'm taking care of them all year round.
