            <p class="about-me-paragraph">I am a game designer looking for a junior role in the game development industry.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">I have been passionate about video games for as long as I can remember. I can learn and acquire skills quickly, I am creative and open to new ideas and experiences. I pay special attention to playability and detail in my projects. I have been interested in game development and the gamedev industry for 5 years, and in game design and software learning for 2 years.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">You can find my resume <a class="hyperlink" href="static/resume/cv-jakub-kowalski-strona.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="about-me-heading">What am I doing?</h2>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">I am currently developing my portfolio, gaining knowledge, polishing my skills and working on my projects. I try to implement my game ideas and mechanisms on an ongoing basis. I create game prototypes mainly in Unreal Engine 5 and program them using Blueprints.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">By day, I study New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Lodz. As part of my specialisation in 'Video Games', I have taken classes in the history and types of video games, game analysis and criticism, game poetics, rule design, gamification, interactive storytelling, as well as interface and user experience. I also have foundational knowledge in the areas of graphic design, new media art, art and design history, databases and information visualisation or generative art.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">In between my studies, I work as an intern in the communications department of a company in the manufacturing industry. Among other things, I am involved in creating social media posts (content, photos, graphics, videos), as well as editing a variety of short promotional videos.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2 class="about-me-heading">My hobbies and interests</h2>
            <p class="about-me-paragraph">In addition to games, I am passionate about computing, new technologies, history and politics. I am also interested in video editing, web development and tinkering with computers and systems. I also love running, cycling, taking care of my bonsai trees and make wine with a good cup of tea, mate or coffee.</p>
